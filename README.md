# Specifics:

The project takes two objects:

 `columnOptions`: Includes the name, sortability (by user), and cell size (small or regular) for the column headers

 `userData`: Entire data that will be displayed on the table.

 Currently both objects are hardcoded, but the code works that with a small adjustment, the table should correctly display any user input, given that they are in the correct object format.

 For the sake of simplicity, the cell size option is only limited to two size, small and regular.
